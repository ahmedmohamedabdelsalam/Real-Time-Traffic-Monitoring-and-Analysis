# Traffic Analysis and Azure Services

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **real-time traffic analysis** and **incident detection** using Python, with the help of **Azure services** for scalable data storage and analysis. The goal is to predict traffic congestion and incidents using machine learning models.

## Key Features
- **Traffic Analysis**: Perform real-time traffic analysis including traffic flow, congestion patterns, and incident detection.
- **Azure Services**: Leverage **Azure Data services** for scalable data storage and analysis.
- **Predictive Models**: Develop models to predict traffic congestion or incidents.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: For data analysis and model development.
  - Libraries: `Scikit-learn`, `Matplotlib`
- **Azure Services**:
  - **Azure Data Studio**: For scalable data storage.
  - **Azure Machine Learning**: For training and deploying machine learning models.

## Project Structure
- **Traffic Analysis**: Perform analysis on real-time traffic data using Python scripts.
- **Model Development**: Build machine learning models to predict traffic congestion and incidents.
- **Azure Integration**: Set up Azure services for scalable data storage and analysis.

## Tasks
1. **Traffic Analysis**:
   - Analyze real-time traffic data to understand patterns and detect congestion.
   - Detect incidents that may impact traffic flow.
2. **Azure Services**:
   - Set up Azure Data Studio to store traffic data.
   - Utilize Azure Machine Learning to develop and deploy predictive models.
3. **Model Development**:
   - Use machine learning techniques (Scikit-learn) to build models predicting traffic congestion or incidents.
   
## Deliverables
- **Traffic Analysis Report**: A comprehensive report that includes traffic flow analysis, congestion patterns, and incident detection.
- **Predictive Models**: Models to predict traffic congestion and incidents.
- **Azure Integration Setup**: Documentation and setup guide for integrating Azure Data services into the project for traffic analysis.
