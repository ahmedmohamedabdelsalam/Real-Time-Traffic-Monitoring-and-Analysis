**Project Idea 4: Real-Time Traffic Monitoring and Analysis**

---

**Week 1: SQL Database and Data Collection**
**Tasks:**
- **Database Design**: Create a SQL database schema for managing traffic data, with tables for:
  - Traffic sensors
  - Traffic logs
  - Incidents
- **Data Collection**: Simulate or use real-time traffic data to populate the database with:
  - Traffic logs
  - Incidents
  - Sensor data
- **SQL Queries**: Write SQL queries to analyze traffic data, such as:
  - Daily traffic summaries
  - Incident reports
  - Sensor statistics
- **Tools**: Microsoft SQL Server, SQL Management Studio

**Deliverables:**
- **SQL database schema** with populated tables for traffic data.
- **SQL queries** for traffic data analysis.

---

**Week 2: Data Warehouse and Python Integration**
**Tasks:**
- **Data Warehouse**: Set up a **data warehouse** to handle and store large volumes of traffic data for analysis.
- **ETL Process**: Implement ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) to load traffic data into the data warehouse.
- **Python Scripting**: Develop Python scripts for:
  - Extracting traffic data
  - Preprocessing data for analysis (using **Pandas** and **pyodbc**)
- **Tools**: Microsoft SQL Data Warehouse, Python (Pandas, SQLAlchemy)

**Deliverables:**
- **Data warehouse setup** integrated with traffic data.
- **Python scripts** for data extraction and preprocessing.

**Week 3: Traffic Analysis and Azure Services**
**Tasks:**
- **Traffic Analysis**: Analyze real-time traffic using Python for:
  - Traffic flow monitoring
  - Detecting congestion patterns
  - Incident detection
- **Azure Services**: Utilize **Azure Data Services** for scalable storage and traffic data analysis.
- **Model Development**: Build predictive models for:
  - Forecasting traffic congestion
  - Incident detection
- **Tools**: Python (Scikit-learn, Matplotlib), Azure Data Studio, Azure Machine Learning

**Deliverables:**
- **Traffic analysis report** with insights on traffic patterns and predictive models.
- **Azure integration** setup for storing and analyzing traffic data.

---

**Week 4: MLOps and Deployment**
**Tasks:**
- **MLOps**: Use **MLflow** to manage, track, and version traffic analysis models.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the traffic analysis model using a real-time service or dashboard for:
  - Monitoring traffic conditions
  - Visualizing congestion or incidents in real-time
- **Final Report and Presentation**: Document the entire project:
  - Database schema and management
  - Data warehousing setup
  - Traffic analysis insights
  - Model deployment
- **Tools**: MLflow, Azure Services, Web frameworks (Flask, Streamlit)

**Deliverables:**
- **Deployed traffic analysis model** or dashboard for real-time traffic monitoring.
- **Final project report** and presentation summarizing all stages.
