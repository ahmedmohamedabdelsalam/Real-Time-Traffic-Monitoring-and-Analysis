# Week 2: Data Warehouse and Python Integration 
## Overview This project focuses on setting up a data warehouse to handle and analyze large volumes of traffic data. It involves the use of ETL processes to load the data into the warehouse and the implementation of Python scripts for data extraction, preprocessing, and preparation for analysis.

## Tasks - **Data Warehouse Setup**: Establish a Microsoft SQL Data Warehouse for storing and analyzing traffic data.
- **Data Loading**: Utilize ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to load traffic data into the warehouse.
- **Python Scripting**: Create Python scripts to: - Extract traffic data.
 - Perform data preprocessing.
 - Prepare data for analysis.

## Tools and Technologies - **Microsoft SQL Data Warehouse**: For data storage and analysis.
- **Python**: For scripting, with the following libraries: - **Pandas**: 

## Deliverables - **Data Warehouse Setup contains**: A fully integrated data warehouse traffic data.
- **Python Scripts**: - Scripts for extracting traffic data from the source.
 - Preprocessing scripts to clean and prepare the data for analysis.
