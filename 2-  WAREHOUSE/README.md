# Week 2: Data Warehouse and Python Integration

## Overview
This project focuses on setting up a data warehouse to handle and analyze large volumes of traffic data. It involves using ETL processes to load the data into the warehouse and implementing Python scripts for data extraction, preprocessing, and preparation for analysis.

## Tasks
- **Data Warehouse Setup**: Establish a Microsoft SQL Data Warehouse for storing and analyzing traffic data.
- **Data Loading**: Utilize ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to load traffic data into the warehouse.
- **Python Scripting**: Create Python scripts to:
  - Extract traffic data.
  - Perform data preprocessing.
  - Prepare data for analysis.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Microsoft SQL Data Warehouse**: For data storage and analysis.
- **Python**: For scripting, with the following libraries:
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - **pyodbc**: For connecting to the SQL Data Warehouse and executing queries.

## Deliverables
- **Data Warehouse Setup**: A fully integrated data warehouse containing traffic data.
- **Python Scripts**: 
  - Scripts for extracting traffic data from the source.
  - Preprocessing scripts to clean and prepare the data for analysis.
