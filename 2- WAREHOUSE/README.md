# Data Warehouse and Python Integration - Week 2: Traffic Data Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on setting up a **data warehouse** to manage and analyze large volumes of traffic data, followed by **data extraction**, **transformation**, and **loading (ETL)** processes. Python scripts are utilized to perform the data extraction, preprocessing, and preparation for analysis.

## Objectives
- **Data Warehouse Setup**: Create a data warehouse using **Microsoft SQL Data Warehouse** to handle large traffic data.
- **ETL Process**: Extract, transform, and load traffic data into the data warehouse.
- **Python Scripting**: Use **Python** to script the data extraction and preprocessing tasks.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Microsoft SQL Data Warehouse**: For setting up and managing the data warehouse.
- **Python**: For ETL operations and data preprocessing.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **pyodbc**: For connecting Python to the SQL Data Warehouse
