# MLOps and Deployment for Traffic Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on integrating **MLOps** practices using **MLflow** for managing traffic analysis models and deploying them as real-time services or dashboards. The goal is to build, track, and deploy models to monitor traffic conditions in real time using Flask and Azure services.

## Key Features
- **MLOps with MLflow**: Manage, track, and version traffic analysis models.
- **Deployment**: Deploy traffic analysis models as a real-time service or dashboard for monitoring traffic conditions.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Document the entire workflow from database management, data warehousing, traffic analysis, to model deployment.

## Tools & Technologies
- **MLflow**: For tracking, managing, and versioning models.
- **Azure Services**: For data storage and model deployment.
- **Flask**: Web framework for deploying the traffic analysis model as a service.
  
## Project Structure
- **Traffic Analysis**: Perform traffic analysis and develop predictive models.
- **MLOps**: Use MLflow to track model versions, parameters, and metrics.
- **Deployment**: Deploy models as a real-time traffic monitoring service using Flask and Azure services.
- **Documentation**: Generate a final project report and presentation covering the entire process.

## Tasks
1. **MLOps with MLflow**:
   - Use MLflow to manage and track models for traffic analysis.
   - Track model versions, metrics, and parameters for reproducibility.
2. **Model Deployment**:
   - Deploy the traffic analysis model as a real-time service or dashboard using Flask.
   - Host the service on Azure for scalable deployment.
3. **Final Report and Presentation**:
   - Document database management, data warehousing, traffic analysis, MLOps process, and model deployment.
   - Prepare a final report and presentation summarizing the entire project.

## Deliverables
- **Deployed Traffic Analysis Model**: A real-time service or dashboard for monitoring traffic conditions.
- **Final Report and Presentation**: Comprehensive documentation of the project.

## Installation and Setup

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mlops-traffic-analysis.git
cd mlops-traffic-analysis

**Install Required Python Libraries**
pip install -r requirements.txt

1. Install MLflow
pip install mlflow

2. Install Flask
pip install Flask

3. Run the Flask app
python app.py


## How to Use the Project
Run Traffic Analysis: Perform traffic analysis and develop the model by running the Python scripts.
Deploy the Model: Deploy the model using the Flask web framework for real-time traffic monitoring.

**Future Improvements**
Improve model performance and add new features for traffic analysis.
Scale the deployment for higher traffic loads.
